    <p>In this Program, i am headed down the path to attain my Bachelor's degree, and become an expert in programming and web development, some things i love doing are playing around on Computer to see what new thing i can learn, i also love music so much singing amd writing of songs</p>
    <p>I am married but have no kids yet, i currently have no job im doing, but i have skills that fetch me income once in a while, and that is why im zealous about this career path, so i can get a better future for myself and family, I love the fact that BYU-Idaho makes education possible for all both virtually and in-person, and give quality education both intellectually and spiritually,</p>
    <p>The advantage of this course to me is that it will help me attain my aim and vision of owning an agency for software development, computer programming, web development e.t.c, i have been a member of The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints for 10 years now, and my favourite quote if from President Thomas S.
